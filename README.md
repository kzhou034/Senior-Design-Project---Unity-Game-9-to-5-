## 9-To-5, a Horde Shooter by Team Henchmen

A first person horde shooter game developed in Unity for my senior design project at UCR. Fight enemies in a towering office building with weapons like laser projectors and keyboard as you aim to climb the ranks and finally retire!

9-To-5 is a horde first person shooter set in an office tower, where you have to defeat hordes of enemies to climb each floor and reach the boss. It takes inspiration from horde shooters from the late 2000s, such as Killing Floor and Left For Dead, that caused a surge of popularity in the genre. 
It is developed in a 3D environment within the Unity game engine, and contains elements such as waves of enemies, different weapons and weapon types, different enemy types, AI pathfinding, projectile collision and health, level transitions, a merchant in between levels, a final boss, and more. 
The player enters each level or floor from an elevator, where they are targeted by moving and shooting enemies that will move around obstacles to reach the player. The player can shoot at the enemy with different weapons, such as a stapler with flying staples, or can hit them with melee objects such as an HDMI cable.
A set amount of enemies spawn in each wave, and the player must defeat all of them before progressing onto the next level. In between levels, the player can buy upgrades and new weapons from money earned from defeating enemies. To win the game, the player must defeat all waves on the final floor, as well as take out the final boss.

We chose Unity as our game engine not only because it is one of the more beginner friendly development platforms, but also for the amount of documentation that exists around it. As well as that, Unity best fits small or solo development teams, unlike other engines such as UE.
The horde shooter genre serves as a great premise for a senior project because of the balance of difficulty in features required to implement. Most games in the development industry require extensive mapmaking, collision and physics implementation, AI movement and interaction, heavy script interaction, and extensive user control. 
Our project helped us learn not only how to design these features that are used in most games but to become more well-rounded in our knowledge of game making. The difficulty for this group project was also beneficial - it wasn't as easy as making an old atari shooter like Asteroids, and it wasn't as difficult (and time consuming) to implement as a real time strategy game. 

## Installation
Since there is no official release, the game is run through the Unity launcher itself. Download Unity as well as the Github zip file. Extract the zip file into the Unity Projects folder. Launch the game from Unity Hub, go to the scenes folder in the bottom of the UI, and select the 'Start' scene. Then click the play icon in the top of the screen.
